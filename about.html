            <h2>What are Their Favorite Treatsies?</h2>
            <p>
                When you bring home your blessed little demonic creature, know that they
                will incessantly beg for treats. We do not take responsibility for any 
                damange incurred by their tantrums, but we must, under law, inform you that 
                the feeding of treats will incur a quick path towards your demise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please ... PLEASE resist the urge to feed your pet treats.
            </p>
            <p> These creatures live on a diet of bones and carcasses. 
                Please ensure that all meals that you provide are from a local and reputable 
                source. Ask us about our free-range options when you come in!

            <p>
                We have been in service to our powerful adoptees for many years, and recently, 
                one of them blessed us with curse defining each and every cat to enter our space 
                an unfathomable amount of power. And now we adopt them out, to you!
                For a fee, of course. <sup><small>*Not your soul*</small></sup>
